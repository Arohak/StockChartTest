## Hint

`
How to calculate performance and compare: 
Let's say for stock XYZ, the first day price is 100, and the second day price is 120 and third day price is 110. So the performance data would be 0%, 20% ,10%. And you can calculate the same way for SPY and return both values as an array/list (with the timestamp of each datapoint) through REST API.
